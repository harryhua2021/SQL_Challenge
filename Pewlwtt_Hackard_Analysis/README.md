# Pewlwtt-Hackard-Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to determine the number of retiring employees by title and identify which employees are eligible to the mentorship program. 

## Result
With the retirment_titles table I can see every employee who is eligible for retirement and for how long they have worked at each position over the course of their entire career.

The unique titles table I created is showing the most recent title for employees of retirment age. Based on the unique_titles table, the majority of the employees of retirment age has Senior Engineer title.

## Conclusion
The majority of the workforce is either retirment or mentorship eligible, so likely there will be many positions open to fill over the next 5 years. It is vital for the management to realize that the experienced workforce in the company will rapidly and drastically decline. Based on the results I see in the analysis, I would recommand management to speed up the hiring process and expand the mentorship program to assit the transfer of experience and knowledge.
